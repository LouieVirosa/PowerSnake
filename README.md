# PowerSnake

Code for generating PowerSnake geocache [GCA2HJ6](https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GCA2HJ6). 

This python3 code generates a random snake-like puzzle that encodes 2 different strings of numbers.
So every time you run it, it will generate a brand new puzzle (but still encodes the same coordinates!)

Of course this puzzle can be solved with any programming language, but why not try Python?

## To Create Your Own Powersnake Puzzle

Simply modify the variables  `encoded_lat` and  `encoded_lon`. The program will ignore all characters that aren't numbers.

When you are ready to generate, type:

```bash
python3 ./challenge.py
```

And your POWERSNAKE puzzle will be generated!

## To Solve The Puzzle

That's for you to figure out! ;D
